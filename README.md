# Car Rental System - C Language Menu Driven Project

The **Car Rental System** is a menu-driven project developed in C language that provides both admin and customer portals for efficient car rental management. The admin portal allows administrators to add car details for rental, including car name, model, price, pickup, and drop-off details. Admins can also delete car details when needed. On the customer portal, users can view car details, check the number of available cars, prices, and rent a car from the pickup location and return it to any drop-off location.
